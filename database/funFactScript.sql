'),(65,''),(66,'Since the Earth is also several million miles closer to the sun at that time of the year than in the summer, sunlight striking the moon was about 7% stronger making it brighter.

In places where the weather was clear and there was a snow cover, even car headlights were superfluous.'),(67,'According to security equipment specialists, security systems that utilize motion detectors won\'t function properly if walls and floors are too hot. When an infrared beam is used in a motion detector, it will pick up a person\'s body temperature of 98.6 degrees compared to the cooler walls and floor.'),(68,''),(69,'If the room is too hot, the motion detector won\'t register a change in the radiated heat of that person\'s body when it enters the room and breaks the infrared beam.

They do it this way, as opposed to the way dogs do it, because they have scent glands in their faces.'),(99,'Cats sleep up to eighteen hours a day, but never quite as deep as humans. Instead, they fall asleep quickly and wake up intermittently to check to see if their environment is still safe.'),(100,'Catnip, or Nepeta cataria, is an herb with nepetalactone in it. Many think that when cats inhale nepetalactone, it affects hormones that arouse sexual feelings, or at least alter their brain functioning to make them feel \"high.\" Catnip was originally made, using nepetalactone as a natural bug repellant, but roaming cats would rip up the plants before they could be put to their intended task.'),(101,'The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ages the equivalent of five human years for every day they live, so they usually die after about fourteen days. When stressed, though, the worm goes into a comatose state that can last for two or more months.
